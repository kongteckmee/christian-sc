# Christian Student Center

This is a 3-page static User Centric frontend development website for a Christian student center. The website started with a warmed welcome with background picture of the saints in student center. This followed by the simple introduction of the usage of student center. This is to give a whole picture on what the student can do in the center. The page ended with what are the upcoming events for students.

The second page, which is the gallery page displayed our collection from variety of events in video and pictures form. While the final page is Meet Us page, that allowed the users to contact the saints, either by the contact details given, or by filling out the form to have the saints to contact them.

## UX
This website acts as an official website for Christian Student Center, showing the usage of this place and the events offer to the campus students. The website should describe the student center in a very simple way, yet giving the information on what is going on at this place. Also, it should let the users know on where is the place and how they can contact the saints.
