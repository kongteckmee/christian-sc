# Christian Student Center

This is a 3-page static User Centric frontend development website for a Christian Student Center. The website started with a warmed welcome with background picture of the saints in student center. This followed by the simple introduction of the usage of student center, that to give a whole picture on what a campus student can do at this place. The page ended with what are the upcoming events for campus students.

The second page, which is the gallery page displayed the collection from variety of events in video and pictures form. While the final page is Meet Us page, that allowed the users to contact the saints, either by the contact details given, or by filling out the form to have the saints to contact them.

## UX
This website acts as an official website of Christian Student Center, showing the usage of this place and the events offer to the campus students. The website should describe the student center in a very simple way, yet giving the information on what is going on at this place. Also, it should let the users know on where is the place and how they can contact the saints.
